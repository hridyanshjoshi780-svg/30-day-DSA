# 30-day-DSA
A 30-day coding journey where I learn and implement Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. Each day includes code, concepts learned, and progress updates.
#30 Days of DSA in C++
Welcome to my 30-day journey of learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms DSA using C++

I'll be showing up here every day with:
   A new concept or problem solved
   C++ code with comments
   What I learned
   Organized daily folders for easy tracking

learning :
day 1 - output string , simple addition program .
day 2 - basic program using for loop, while loop, do while loop .
day 3 - patterns using for loop .
day 4 - conditional statements (if else ) . 
day 5 - calculator with input validation and a simple factorial program (both using function) .
day 6 - hollow diamond using function .

 Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Editor: VS Code
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

 Why I’m Doing This
I want to:
- Strengthen my DSA fundamentals
- Build a daily coding habit
- Share my progress publicly for accountability
- Inspire and connect with fellow learners!
